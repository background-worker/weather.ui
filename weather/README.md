# Weather

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.6. This is the frontend part of the [Weather API](background-worker/weather.api).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Working

Once the application is up and running, add the required fields for **Country, City and ApiKey** to get the weather description.

There is a set of only 5 API Keys which can be found in _appsettings.json_ file of the backend part - [Weather API](background-worker/weather.api). Only 5 requests can be made every hour using an API Key.
